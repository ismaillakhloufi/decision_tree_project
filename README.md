# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

A machine learning project to predict heart disease presence using a Decision Tree classifier. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

- **Source**: `heart_disease_uci.csv` (UCI Heart Disease Dataset)
- **Features**:  
  `age`, `sex`, `cp` (chest pain type), `trestbps` (resting blood pressure), `chol` (cholesterol), `fbs` (fasting blood sugar), and others.
- **Target**: `num` (presence of heart disease: 0 = no disease, 1-4 = disease severity).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter
